# Production Deployment

This directory contains configurations, scripts, and templates for deploying Ray Data LLM in production environments. It supports the Production Deployment section in the main README.md.

## Directory Structure

- **terraform/** - Infrastructure as Code templates for provisioning cloud resources
- **kubernetes/** - Kubernetes manifests for deploying Ray clusters and LLM services
- **monitoring/** - Monitoring and observability configurations
- **scripts/** - Utility scripts for deployment, maintenance, and operations
- **config/** - Configuration files and templates for production environments

## Getting Started with Production Deployment

1. Start by reviewing the infrastructure requirements in the terraform directory
2. Deploy the Kubernetes resources using the manifests in the kubernetes directory
3. Set up monitoring using the configurations in the monitoring directory
4. Use the utility scripts for day-to-day operations

## Best Practices

For production deployments, follow these guidelines:

1. **Resource Planning**: Carefully size your clusters based on expected workload
2. **High Availability**: Deploy across multiple availability zones
3. **Security**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Monitoring**: Set up comprehensive monitoring and alerting
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Configure regular backups and recovery procedures

Refer to the main [README Production Deployment section](../README.md#12-production-deployment) for detailed guidance.
